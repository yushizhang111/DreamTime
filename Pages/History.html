          <p>The History of Indigenous Australians began at least 65,000 years ago when Aboriginal Australians
            populated Australia.
            The Aboriginals were semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers with a strong spiritual connection to the land, water,
            and animals.
            Each group developed skills for the area in which they would live, with significant diversity between
            groups.</p>
          <p>The origin of Australia's Indigenous people remains a matter of debate and conjecture.
            They are believed to be among the earliest human migrations out of Africa.
            Although they likely migrated to Australia through Southeast Asia they are not demonstrably related to any
            known Asian or Polynesian population.
            There is evidence of genetic and linguistic interchange between Australians in the far north and the
            Austronesian peoples of modern-day New Guinea and the islands, but this may be the result of recent trade
            and intermarriage.</p>

          <p>The Australian Aboriginal Flag was designed by artist Harold Thomas and was first flown at Victoria Square
            in Adelaide, SA, on National Aborigines Day, 12 July 1971.
          <p>It became the official flag for the Aboriginal Tent Embassy in Canberra after it was first flown there in 1972.
              Since then, it has become a widely recognised symbol of the unity and identity of Aboriginal people.</p>
          <p>The Aboriginal flag is divided horizontally into halves. The top half is black and the lower half red.
              There is a yellow disk in the centre of the flag.
              The black represents the Aboriginal people of Australia.The red represents the red earth, the red ochre
              used in ceremonies and Aboriginal people’s spiritual relation to the land.
              The Yellow disk represents the Sun, the giver of life and protector.</p>

          <p>Australian Aboriginal culture can claim to be the oldest continuous living culture on the planet.
            Recent dating of the earliest known archaeological sites on the Australian continent - using
            thermo-luminescence and other modern dating techniques - have pushed back the date for Aboriginal presence
            in Australia to at least 40,000 years. Some of the evidence points to dates over 60,000 years old.</p>
          <p>The hallmark of Aboriginal culture is 'oneness with nature'. In traditional Aboriginal belief systems, nature and landscape are comparable in importance to the bible in Christian culture.
            Prominent rocks, canyons, rivers, waterfalls, islands, beaches and other natural features - as well as sun,
            moon, visible stars and animals - have their own stories of creation and inter-connectedness.</p>
          <p>To the traditional Aborigine they are all sacred: environment is the essence of Australian Aboriginal
            godliness. Out of this deep reverence for nature Aborigines learned to live in remarkable harmony with the land and
            its animals. It seems there's a lot our modern world can learn from these people.</p>
